Public transport is nearby and really accesible (€1,40 for every form of public transport for 90 min - june 2017).

We live in a rural area and aren't used to a lot of city noise, so we brought along (wax) earplugs, and needed them. In the morning there is construction noise from other apartment, so we enjoyed a bit of siësta every other day :-)!

Stelios is a really friendly host, easy to communicate with. He picked us up from the metrostation and showed us where the apartment was.

The only potential drawback: being in Psyrii the unit can get some street noise at night, and the bells of the nearby Orthodox Church were very active on Sunday morning.

That may be only when I stayed in mid July but just in case you should know. In addition, he had a friend who drives a cab, so last

He was helpful by text, phone, and email, always responsive.  Very professional, friendly, and positive.

We were running late from our drive back from Delphi and Stelio was in constant contact. The street was a little hard to find for our Uber Driver, but Stelios was waiting in the street for us (for a late night check-in). He even helped us carry our baggage up as we had a baby and ton of things. 

The street is covered in graffiti (and so is most of Athens), so I was a bit skeptical when we first arrived. The building itself is mostly empty, so that may put you off at first as well. But once we entered the apartment, we were pleasantly surprised at how big it was. There were fresh sheets and linens (the sheets smelled amazing) and place was really clean. Wi-fi was great as well. 

The location of the apartment can't be beat. You can walk to everything and the street itself has this cool circus theme restaurant that was quiet an attraction at night. 

My only complain was that it was a little loud at night in the room that was facing the restaurant next door when they had music nights. But we just slept in the other room that night and we were fine.  "

1) It feels like nobody ever actually lived in it. It was redesigned and renovated to be an Airbnb place, and it shows. There were important things missing in the kitchen, I found only one large pot and one small frying pan. As I was going to spend 10 days there, I bought some pieces of cookware, incl. a small pot to boil water (there is no kettle), plus paper towel, tin foil etc.. Also, no tea towels (I used a bath towel). In the shower there are no shelves for shampoo etc. I know these are small details, but it is what makes you feel at home in an Airbnb place.
2) The location, though unbeatable in terms of centrality, was also a big problem at night, as it is smack in the centre of the hub of night life in Athens. Starting after midnight, and going on even to 4 or 5 am in the weekends, I was woken up by people yelling, singing out loud, playing music, laughing, smashing bottles etc. Being on the third floor, you could hear all this as if it was right outside your window. Besides, even on nights that were not particularly hot, I had to use the a/c because I did not want to open the windows due to the noise.

Stelios was very accurate and reliable. The place does not have a dishwasher, as I had read on the website, but it has a washing machine (although there are no tools for hanging your laundry).

200140,1,,Self Enquiry,1,15,Female,2,3,Basic,5,1,4,1,,rain,"The house was spacious and had everything you could possibly need. Initially I thought our location was in a bit run down area, but there was a whole area of nice restaurants and cafes a block down from where we were located, much quieter and less touristy than monastiraki, ermou and surrounds. Yes there are some streets I would avoid (as there are in most of central Athens), but this one generally had a bit of foot traffic and if you follow Stelios' advice you should be right. All the tourist areas were pretty close, monastiraki metro station is a short 4-5 minute stroll and is on 2 of the 3 the metro lines, or one stop from syntagma to get you to the third.
As to the title modern and comfy flat, that's exactly was it is. Beds were comfy, TV was great, washing machine did the work, all pretty good. My wife, who is picky as, said it was the best accommodation during our five week Greece trip. She also wanted me to highlight in the review that Stelios place was the only accommodation during this trip to provide washing powder with the washing machine so we didn't have to go out and unnecessarily buy a whole box. In addition to these little touches Stelios provided ear plugs, which had us a bit worried, but after the first night we got used to the general hubbub. Even though we were there for a week, we don't believe the restaurant below opened so I can't comment on it (unless it was really quiet).
Overall Stelios tried to make sure we enjoyed ourselves. Even though his place is pretty popular, he also arranged for us to leave the room a bit later and offered to store our bags for our very late flight."

From  the roof you have and incredible view to the Acropolis by night. Hosts are always available for any query. The kitchen is modern and well equiped. But in the other hand, the street where the house is, has a lot, really a lot, of slope and this can be a problem for someone who can not make efforts (I had to be helped by my children). And in this house, as in almost every house where we have been in Greece, the shower piece can not be hung from the wall when bathing. You can only have it in your hand. (Apparently when greeks take a shower they usually get wet first with the shower piece in their hand, then cut the water and soapy and then drop the water again to remove the soap. It will be very eco-friendly by saving water, but it is really annoying for those of us who are accustomed to bathing under permanent water. In addition it is cold when cutting the water.) Additionally, the host forgot to comunicate the first day that we have to turn on a key to get hot water, so we had to bath with warm/cold water. The rooms are on a high floor so you hve to climb stairs.

The location is very good--very near to the Acropolis (15-20 min walk) and the metro station is really close (if you don't want to walk). The apartment itself is quite okay, but you probably won't spend too much time there. The bar downstairs is indeed very noisy so if you're a bad sleeper or bring small kids, don't take this one, but if you want to spend the nights at one of the many very nice terraces in the neighbourhood, keep your windows closed or your earplugs in reach, you're quite okay."

Clean, tidy and very well-organised apartment! Just a stone's throw from Akadimias & Zoodohou Pigis corner (""Akadimia"" metro station). Ideal for 2 or 3 people. Ok even for 4 people for one or two nights-only if they feel very comfortable with one another (2 will have to share a quite big sofa at the ""sitting room"").

The only con I have to mention was the internet speed. I was there for work and needed to upload heavy files. The connection was too slow for what I needed and that was a bit of an issue for me. 
If you just need email and browsing the internet you'll be totally fine. If you need more than that, just check that with her. I am convinced that it was the company's fault and not Elissavet's and I'm sure she'll solve it. 
Overall is a great value place and I would book again with no hesitation.

Her son met us on time at the apartment and took us through how everything works and gave us advice on what to see and do in the area. There is also a handy information booklet. He also provided us with his and Stella's mobiles to contact them if ever we needed anything.

The apartment itself is newly furnished and beautifully done. It really feels like home away from home. All the amenities work perfectly. After a hard day seeing the sites, it is a pleasure to come home to this apartment and relax after a long day.

Location of the apartment is excellent. It's ever so slightly outside of the overly touristic areas which we liked, but they are a very short walk away. There are lots of restaurants within a few minutes walk, and all of them looked pretty good. We ate at a few and never had a bad meal. There are 2 decent supermarkets within 100 metres as well.

Later we were contacted by the host that there were oil stains found on the sofa hence an additional Euro 100 plus is required to replace the cover if the stains cannot be cleaned. We were at a loss and checked with the host where the stains were as one of us remembered seeing some stains below the front cover cloth on the sofa seat too. Later we saw a photo posted by the host, where the stains are on the back rest of middle of sofa. We are most certain that we did not create the stain.

John's apartment is spacious, fully-air-conditioned, well-equiped, secure, clean, and perfectly located in the heart of Athens just a few blocks from Syntagma Square in one direction and Monastraki in the other. The bedrooms are quiet and comfortable; the mattresses and bed linens are great.  It was (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) F when we were in Athens volunteering at a refuge camp. Returning to John's elegant apartment with its powerful a/c each night was a godsend. What's more, John and his wife were excellent hosts: thoughtful, kind, and communicative.  They welcomed us so warmly and were on hand during our stay  for whatever we needed. They also stocked the refrigerator for us with breakfast foods, fresh fruit, cold water, juice, and even a bottle of wine, which lasted us throughout the week.  They clearly bend over backwards to make your stay perfect.

In addition to big things like an elevator and a laundry machine, the apartment comes loaded with all sorts of little, important amenities, from extensive toiletries, to a Nespresso machine, to first aid supplies, to listing of local shops and restaurants. Although the front living room with its charming balcony overlooks a lively pedestrian street with several stylish bars that stay open until the wee hours of the night, you do not hear the noise at all in the rest of the apartment. I am an incredibly light sleeper, but I slept so well at John's.  The bedrooms are peaceful.

The only issue anyone might have is that the shower is a bit awkward. It is set inside a small tub with two levels in it. It might  not be the best for people who are very tall or people with knee problems who have trouble climbing in and out of bathtubs. But the shower itself is good with strong water pressure. 

I hope to stay at John's again when I return to Athens; I only I that I'll be able to after the word gets out about how lovely his apartment is!"

As you step inside the front door of the building in the evening you can't help but feel part of the city's buzz right on the doorstep. Trendy Athenians chilling out. Don't worry however, the two bedrooms are at the rear of the apartment and are truly peaceful. Quite a good trick! The best of both worlds in our opinion. The apartment is stylish with some gorgeous furniture. Lovely original details. Marble sink in the kitchen, original presses. John is a very generous host. He left a stocked fridge, a Nespresso machine with full supplies of coffee and a whole range of bits and pieces to make us feel comfortable and welcome. As a transport strike had been threatened for the day of our departure John stepped in and drove us to the airport. A very kind gesture. No strike went ahead but that kindness eased any travel anxieties on our part. We will return here if there's availability. Highly recommend. Thank you John."

The building itself is quiet, and overall noiseless for a good night’s sleep.  We never felt unsafe in this area.  Outside the apartment, down the wide alleyway slightly, are a few bars/restaurants that were covered with mostly young locals over the weekend.  We loved this aspect of the location as it was a convenient place to end the night for a drink but was never rowdy or disruptive to our stay a few steps away.  The Acropolis was ~10 to 15 minute leisurely walk from here. Everywhere we wanted to see in relation to tourism and everywhere we wanted to eat was within 20ish walking distance from here.  

Lastly, John was an impeccable host.  He met us at the corner when our taxi arrived and helped us with our luggage as we got up to the apartment. He has everything available you could have possibly forgotten and more (think cozy robes or even umbrellas).  We had fresh bread and fruit waiting for us as we arrived.  Each morning I was able to have my choice espresso drink, my mom could have her coffee, and my sister could get her tea fix all because John was so gracious to have all of these available.  Just to top it off, the beds are even comfortable.  I would recommend this place in a heartbeat to anyone visiting Athens."

I could just relist what all the other reviewers have written about the apartment,  John giving  him and extra couple of stars etc. but I'd just be repeating what's already been said.

The one thing I will add is that we particularly liked the balcony.  Having some breakfast out there in the morning and a quiet drink in the afternoon was a great way to start and end the day."

The location was close to the must see sights and restaurants.  The apartment (studio) was much smaller than I expected, but the outside space made up for it.  It was very clean and organized.  AC was great for the Athens heat!

Unfortunately, I think we just had bad luck at this apartment.  Minutes before we arrived, we were told that previous guests had broken something and they needed time to fix it.  Host allowed us to drop our bags, but then asked us to leave with no approximate time as to when we could come back.  There is not a real kitchen.  There is a mini fridge and one hot plate.  There is no microwave, oven, stove, or trash can.  This was a disappointment as we could not cook meals, and had no where to store trash.  Host requested that we take the trash out to a community trash bin a couple streets down.

The worst part was we had no hot water the entire 4 days we were there.  There is a note stating to turn the boiler switch on.  It took us 30 minutes to find the switch and once it was turned on, it still never produced hot water.  We reached out to host who said she could get ""an expert"" to fix it but we were uncomfortable with that as we had tours that day and all our stuff was there.  The host did offer us a free stay for our troubles, but it is for this Christmas.  Being from the US and just spending a month abroad for our honeymoon, it is not feasible to come back so soon and during that time.

The host was very kind and responded to messages quickly.  "

We spent our last 10 days in Greece at Thasos’s place after 3 years leaving in the suburb of Athens and we enjoyed it very much.

It’s also very close to Pireas by metro, so easy to get in a ferry.
But most important: the house is clean, comfy, very quiet and very charming! You are indeed in a fairytale when you’re having breakfast on a bed of bougainvillea flowers and more are falling like flower snow!!

The Host
Alexis picked us up from the airport which was really nice of him. He helped us with picking up our luggage from the airport to his car to the apartment. We had a nice pleasant conversation with him on the way. He suggested some nice places to visit and how to spend our time. His mother even picked up a pack of cold beer for me which was helpful in the really hot days in August. On the way back Alexis was working so his wife helped us back to the airport and helped us with the luggage. I would say they are the nicest host I have ever met. Very helpful and very kind and caring. They were available for all our needs.
The Apartment
This place is no frills, simple and compact apartment. There is one A/C in the room which can cool the outside living room when the door is open. The A/C power that we are used in North America is not the same as Europe. We are used to full blast A/C power but in Europe its different. The apartment was clean but can use some simple upgrades. The toilet and bathing area was especially very small with a washing machine. Otherwise there was a full refrigerator and pots and pans.
Overall it was a good value considering the price we paid. I would like to thanks Alexis and his family for taking so good care of us."

The apartment is ideally located - just down the road from the Acropolis and within easy walking distance of many key places. I cant think of anything I would have changed - it all worked so smoothly for us and I would 101% recommend this apartment to others and would love to go back. 

The only thing i would change about our trip was knowing from day 1 that there are much cheaper places to eat-out in one direction than the other. If you are on a budget like we were, check out the area aroundMONASTIRAKI about 15 mins walk away. Lovely Greek food and countless cafes and restaurants shops etc. Better priced than down the road from the apartment. (it was August though, so several places were closed for a few weeks)"

Further it's in walking distance from the metro-station Kerameikos, which can be reached directly from the airport.

The appartment is spacy and offers room for at least 3 - maybe 4 persons. It's very clean and the kitchen is well-equipped. As it is situated at the corner of Iraklidon and Thessalonikis, which is a street with more traffic and also an elevated Metro-line above the street, it's not totally quiet, but if you open the window in night-time only to the Iraklidon it is bearable.

Major plus point, the place is a 3-4 minute walk to an amazing array of restaurants (PLAKA neighborhood?) where we had the most amazing food, especially kebabs at O Thanasis. We also met Alexis and his mom, who went above and beyond the call of hospitality required. See Athens has a flat fare taxi rate from the Airport to Athens city center for 38 EUR and Alexis's place falls within the set boundary, dont let anyone tell you otherwise. However, we seemed to have gotten a  (rare) taxi driver who kept saying it wasnt and kept us on the meter.

The location was great if you want to feel more like a local and be a little outside of the high volume traffic. Neighborhood is charming and quiet.

Positives:

- place was extremely clean and spotless
- the flat comes with floor heating and although really big space kept really warm
- Maria the cleaner was really friendly and hospitable
- hippy kind of quiet area and close to many shops, restaurants and bars
- comes with most amenities

Areas of improvement

- the place is very big with massive windows everywhere but no curtains only electric blinds meaning you couldn’t walk inside the house comfortably as the neighbours from both front and back can see straight through inside. Place needs curtains for sure.
- there is no TV but very fast internet 
-there is only one set of keys and they ask for us to constantly lock the reception door and the flat door meaning that if one of the two needs to go out and reception door is locked they will have to either take the keys or go down open the door go back to the flat and leave the keys and go out again.

I would give in general 3.5/5"

You can enter through the garage straight into the elevator which is rare in Athens and means zero stairs if you are handicapped or have a stroller. The downside is there is no over, not even a toaster so don’t plan on cooking anything here. Also we had a small baby with us, we asked multiple times about the crib and even asked if it was set up right before we arrived which was confirmed. The woman Maria who checked us in however was rude, the crib was not set up. When we asked her to help, she tried to blow us off saying moms always know how to set it up and she didn’t want to spend all Day there helping. I insisted something wasn’t right and it seemed broken and that she must stay to set it up. Turns out after almost an hour and the baby now well past nap time from a long flight and so tired, it was indeed broken and turns out it wasn’t used in over a month and she didn’t check after the last guests used it if it was in good condition. She had to call the owner of the apartment whose girlfriend rushed to get us a new one. By the time we got one, it was two hours after check in so we lost a large portion of our last day in Athens, the baby missed his nap and so was in a horrible mood and crying for the remainder.

However there are some issues you need to be aware of. The keys are in a lockbox at the front door that is not easy to open. Be aware its an IQ test to make it work. Pull on the front of the lock after you input the code. Once you have the keys its very smooth to operate, but returning them was an issue as we had to wake the maid to return them which is probably not her job. Then again whose job is it ? I saw no instructions about the return of keys. 
The host may not answer your questions. I asked about which bus to take 3 different before being told to take the metro.
The bedroom door in 1A does not close at all.
The stereo has no needle so you cannot play any music.
The shower does not drain well.
A typical absent landlord which given the friendly spirit of Athens I was a little surprised at the lack of customer service.

Nichole is an amazingly thoughtful host. She provided us with numerous suggestions for dinner, shopping, and such, complete with website links. :-) This information was highly appreciated. We were only in Athens for two nights and took her suggestion to visit thePLAKA for dinner. We found an outdoor restaurant with two musicians playing the whole time we were there and, aside from the Acropolis and its museum, that dining experience is one of the highlights in Athens.

Nichole's communication with us was exemplary. She responded with us immediately and with genuine care.

The building itself is pretty old and worn down. The building next door is abandoned and a complete mess. The area looked a bit sketchy initially; but after being there a couple of nights, it seemed to be a fairly quiet neighborhood. 
The key to the front building entrance broke the first night we used it and got stuck in the lock. Luckily, another local tenant was able to pull out the broken piece of key that night so the door could lock. We called Nicole about this and she immediately had a new key sent to us the following morning. 
We were awoken in the evening a couple times due to the window shaking and rattling from cars driving by (and I sleep through everything).

She provided a mobile wi-fi unit, snacks and coffee, maps and guides to Athens, clear instructions for how to work all the appliances and probably the best-smelling artisan Greek soap ever. The apartment is perfect for a solo traveler: small and simple yet elegant and welcoming. 

The apartment is not in the direct center of Athens but it's a dead easy walk to the Metro, plus it's still in its own little hive of activity yet on a quiet street. I liked going back each night a little out of the way of the craziness of the center. Don't be uneasy about the entrance - the building next to it is having a frightful amount work done at the moment, and the apartment's building itself isn't much to look at, but once you're inside it's an oasis.

I would recommend this apartment hands-down and plan on staying there again the next time I am in Athens."

By nice idea, I mean, that after reading all the amazing reviews and great photography, we thought we were walking into a perfect place... But, this wasn't exactly true:
> The shower was strangely set-up and somewhat unfinished (we had to hold the shower-head up by hand). The bedroom windows were totally covered-up because the windows were old and looks quite dirty. The glass-wall was great, except the finishes/construction seemed rushed. It feels like a converted office, and you can see why in an office setting things like this might not be a big deal (there is also an office next door).

Overall, it was clean and the space is very large with good light - in a nice part of the City with plenty of restaurants, cafes, and high street shops close by."

201386,0,26,Self Enquiry,1,6,Male,3,3,Basic,5,1,5,2,17867,rain,"This is not a luxury apartment and we found the price all in all far too high for what you get: as matter of fact the flat was once an office, and it shows. 

1)The apartment is situated in a very busy area, as long as cafes and restaurants are concerned. But the location is also what turns the bedroom into a nightmare: we stayed a week, and we had to buy earplugs in order to be able to sleep: the bedroom is right above Emour Street, a very busy shopping street : it was loud day and night and sadly only a thin and normal window, not insulating, separates you from the noise. Also the heating (air conditioned) is very noisy.

2) The furniture is ok, essential but cheap: abundant compressed wood and silicone everywhere. Fine with me, but why define it 'luxury'?

3) The view through the big glass wall is indeed spectacular but as someone has already pointed out, the glass-wall is very badly finished and it turns the apartment into a big draughty room.

4) The kitchen is essential and clean, but doesn't have hot water so we had to heat water in a boiler everytime we needed to wash dishes!

5)The bathroom is a nonsense: the shower stands between the washbasin and the toilet so if you happen to need the toilet after someone has taken a shower, you are forced to walk through the wet shower tray. Also you must remember to heat the water 20 minutes before taking a shower!!! And don't forget to switch off the boiler.

Although we found the apartment very disappointing, I must concede Grigoris is a nice person.

The only issues we had were with the finishings and amenities. The whole place felt very unfinished and not well planned. The kitchen was tiny and was just some waterproofed chipboard made into shelves and cupboards. The bathroom layout was weird. You have to walk through the wet shower area to get to the toilet. Also the door to the bathroom isnt really a door. Its a lump of frosted glass that kind of rests on the wall. The shower head is at waist height so you essentially have to have a horizontal shower and aim the water at your stomach or hold it up yourself. There were screws sticking out of the wall behind the toilet and the seat just rested on it and had to be readjusted every time. 
There's only one set of keys and the host strongly encouraged locking the door with the key when you're at home and when you go out so if you travel in a group or couple, everyone has to leave together or all stay home. 
The street is so noisy! Dont stay here unless you love to party and dont plan on sleeping before midnight. There were loud shops and dance music at all hours of the night. We used noise cancelling headphones to sleep. "

201403,0,39,Self Enquiry,3,21,Male,3,3,Super Deluxe,5,1,1,2,28341,sun,"Grigoris' apartment is the most scenic place you can find in Athens, with an AMAZING view upon the acropolis. Located in monastiraki, the heart of the city, next door to a street full of Greek restaurants and a small walk from everything you wish to see in Athens. 

The large glass wall let you enjoy the amazing view from the large living-room without noticeable privacy issue. 
The bathroom is smaller but satifactory, you may simply need a bit (just a little bit) of organisation before going for a shower as to make the most of the space available in the bathroom. 

Grigoris picked my mother and I at theMONASTIRAKI metro station (3 min walk) and gave up tips about where to find good restaurants. 
The apartment itself was outstandingly clean with a tastefull decoration. We felt expected and welcome by lovely gestures like fresh flowers, drinks in the fridge, nicely folded hand towels, perfumed bedding...Also an interesting art-design book collection!

If you are looking for a spectacular place to stay while in Athens... Grigoris' place must be your first choice.

201410,0,40,Self Enquiry,3,8,Female,3,3,Deluxe,4,4,3,1,20677,rain,"We loved our stay! The host met us at the metro station and gave us a brief introduction to the city. We were dehydrated from all of our travel and he even had cold water waiting in the fridge. The location was great; walkable to pretty much everything. Acropolis took us maybe 15 minutes to walk to. There's a cool rooftop bar nearby called Cafe Zen that offered cheap drinks (at least compared to US standards) and great food (veggie friendly). This flat is out of the main touristy drag (it feels a bit more like a combination of visitors and tourists), which was nice. 

The only thing I'd suggest is maybe bringing earplugs and an eye mask. For all the awesome things this place has to offer, it's very loud at night (I don't think the Greeks ever sleep!!) and the room never becomes particularly dark (though the host is upfront about that in his listing). If you are a light sleeper, you may want to be prepared. "

201412,0,,Self Enquiry,1,6,Male,3,3,Basic,4,2,5,1,,rain,"The Acropolis view apartment and our experience in Athens overall exceeded our wildest expectations and we're already longing to return. When we do, we would DEFINITELY stay at Grigoris' place again - it was absolutely phenomenal.

THE LOCATION: It doesn't get better than this. A block or two from a metro station that'll take you to and from the airport. Centrally located amidst tons of shops, a flea market, a nearby supermarket, and tons of spots for delicious al fresco dining. And as you can tell from the photos, the view is an absolute stunner - one of the best I've ever experienced in my lifetime. Not only are you relaxing in the shadow of the Acropolis, there are tons of other nearby landmarks and beautiful old buildings guiding your eye up to the monument. We didn't need a car at all and found it very easy to walk to an array of sites, bites, and more.

THE HOME: The apartment is a penthouse in a former hat factory and it's full of beautiful, modern furnishings and a well-equipped mini kitchen for your use. It was hard to leave that beautiful terrace and we loved spending our early evenings sipping wine out there and watching the moon rise over the mountains in the distance. The bedroom was very comfortable and we really appreciated the AC unit in there so we could stay cool during those warm June nights. The only detriment might be the bathroom as you have to walk through the shower to get to the toilet, but it was not an issue for us at all.

THE HOSPITALITY: Grigoris was an exceptional host, helping us every step of the way to coordinate check in and even meeting us at the metro station so he could walk us to the place and help us get situated. He talked us through a map of the area and helped orient us to all the things we could've needed. He was friendly, flexible, and communicative with any questions we had. 

ATHENS TIPS: This city BLEW US AWAY. I can't recommend traveling to Athens enough! The Thanasis kebab place just out the door from the AirBnB was spectacularly delicious and we also had a beautiful, slightly more upscale but still inexpensive meal at Dionysos Zonars - a 20-ish minute walk from the apartment on the other side of the Acropolis. The Acropolis was incredible but the museum knocked our socks off even more. Highly recommend getting the 30 euro pass which allows you access to the Acropolis and many other nearby sites over the course of 5 days. We also enjoyed a day trip to Delphi, which also had incredible views, antiquities, and a little more privacy. If you do a Delphi trip, I'd get a package that DOESN'T include lunch as there are many spots in the area worth exploring on your own. Overall one of our favorite cities in Europe - we're sure to return someday!"

The apartment has great views of the Acropolis, especially in the evening! Guests should be aware that there are no curtains/blinds in the main living area (per the pictures) which may be problematic for guests concerned about privacy. Also, due to the narrow bathroom design, you need to walk through the shower to get to the toilet. These were not a big deal to us though.

It's perfectly central to monastiraki - which is quite noisy so for those who are light sleepers bring ear plugs. However I was aware that this area is noisy and it was a weekend so slept quite soundly anyway. 
I cannot recommend this Airbnb highly enough and communication with grigoris was easy and speedy.

A restaurant (O Thanasis) selling large portions if Greek food, very cheaply, is a few metres away. The view from the balcony of the Acropolis, which is floodlit at night, is something that alone is almost worth the cost of the flat!

Very good host who met us at the metro station before taking us the very short distance to the flat. The flat was very well equipped.

Of course, being in the centre of a busty part of a busy city carries with it inevitable consequences. Although on the 6th floor the noise is noticeable, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights. Nothing more than you would find in a similar position in any busy city, but if you are a very light sleeper, take some good earplugs.

Take care on the underground – pickpockets abound. Take care with the taxis. They will try and cover up the meter and then invent a price, and do not always know where they are going. Keep (Hidden by Airbnb) maps open on your phone to make sure you are where you want to be before getting out of the car."

It's a stylish, cosy and comfortable place and I felt very much safe and at ease. You are at the top of a building (there are two elevators) so the view of Athens is quite impressive, especially since there's a wall of glass in the stretched living room and you can watch everything very easily from almost everywhere. It was just a little too cold to sit and eat outside, but that probably adds some extra flavour to the whole experience.

The apartment is smack in the middle of a very busy part of Athens, but the noise outside was very doable (I used some earplugs as well, just to be sure). You can walk up to the Acropolis in 15 minutes, there are supermarkets within a few minutes (and a Starbucks within a minute of leaving the building), and if you like Souvlaki and Gyros you can literally eat your heart out. My overall experience is very positive, not in the least because Grigoris responds really quickly. I totally and warmly recommend this place!"

It is practically almost like having the flat to yourself, since the kitchen and bathroom are very easily shared with just one other person.

Even when it came down to a recommendation for a Greek designer for new dress or the stash of cotton balls (how many guys think of little things like that?), Yannis had it covered.

There it is, the beginning of my review.  SPECTACULAR.  One word only.
If you do not stay here, you are foolish beyond words.
First off, there is the view, which is AMAZING beyond belief, the Acropolis right there in front of you in all its glory.  Not a side view or a tiny little view from some window, NO, out on the balcony, face on is the Acropolis.  So if you do not like the whole touristy thing, the view from this apartment is where you need to be.
Next is the host himself, get ready to be critiqued over your top 5 movies. (Yes he is a movie buff)  He does make a mean Expresso from his new machine.  Yannis was a fantastic guide, and loved to talk about movies and Athens.  Loved him.
The apartment itself is clean and what a space.  My room was mosquito proofed and is completely private and at the back of the apartment so was quiet.  The only thing was the church bells ringing out there music, but they were completely charming and part of thePLAKA Experience. 
And for the solo ladies, there is a lock on the door for your complete privacy, not that you need it with Yanni's as he is a complete gentleman.
So if you like travelling in Style, having a superb place to be with a brilliant host, love shopping and love to be in the heart of Athens, thePLAKA, this is your place to stay. 
It was SPECTACULAR.....................

Yannis was very hospitable and showed me around when I first got in and was accommodating when my flight at the tail end of my trip was late. Yannis also provided little treats throughout the stay and really enjoys the company of travelers!"

A couple of observations: the area is a bit noisy, which didn't bother me but some may find that bothersome. I actually love the area with its many local shops.

One metro line that runs there takes you straight to the airport in 40 minutes, the other one to Piraeus, the main sea port of Athens in about 30 minutes.

To begin, the building location is within 50 meters ofMONASTIRAKI Square, which is the heartbeat of Athens. The Acropolis, Mars Hill, and the best shopping and dining in the city are all within walking distance. The subway is steps from the building entry if you need.  

Besides a few stairs at the entry, accessibility is good. Both apartments are on the 6th floor with a small elevator and no thresholds to the showers.

Both apartments are newly remodeled with nice marble, tile, and laminate flooring and stylish modern tiles, cabinets, and decore. Both have huge decks. The smaller has nice awnings to protect that side from the otherwise harsh afternoon sun. The smaller apartment also has a large living area, a nice kitchenette, beautiful bathroom (with a view with the window open) and a large bedroom that leads to the apartment's private deck.

The larger apartment is similar but with a larger bathroom and two large bedrooms, both with access to an equally amazing private deck. Both apartments have views of the Acropolis from equally large decks. The larger apartment probably has a marginally better view but you won't feel like you're missing out with either apartment. 

Ana and Efi were very easy to work with in the booking process and very prompt to respond to my many questions. Anna was there to greet us even though I only gave her 20 minutes notice of our arrival. She provided a brief but thorough rundown of the apartments and offered to help us if we needed anything... Which we didn't because wine, treats and Greek coffee were thoughtfully provided! 

Lastly we loved to access to a quality wash machine that is shared the two apartments in a common hall.

Overall, we couldn't recommend Anna and Efi's apartments any higher. While this was our first experience with Airbnb, knowing there are gems like Ana and Efi's will make us rethink booking again in hotels!"

I also had a very late flight and was picked up by Lazarus and brought to the apartment that was a terrific service for 50 euros. The highlight of the apartment was definitely the balcony I spent most of my time at the apartment there. There were a couple things that were pretty bad that nobody has commented on . I encountered aggressive pan handlers at the front door one of which followed me into the building that I had to physically remove. I walked up once to someone urinating on the door step and others who used it for a bar. As a single male I was able to deal with it but I would not recommend for families or anyone who may be easily intimidated .1 more thing that I will address at the end. Now for the ugly, the shower is DANGEROUS I recognized the danger when I got there and pondered going 3 days without a shower and in the end I probably should have not used it . I showered on the last day and the shower was so slippery I slipped and fell hitting my head on the marble floor as well as landing on my hip giving me a nasty bruise (I am still crossing my fingers that I did not crack my hip). I am 50 years old and I think I may have gotten lucky to not have permanent injuries from the fall. I would not recommend the apartment for older people because of that danger. I choose this apartment because of the balcony and I paid more because the reviews made it seem more high end then it was. People spoke of being left Greek wine,pastries and other goodies but all that was left for me was a bottled water. Finally I am going to post about this because I am going to receive my first negative review but I am going to leave an honest review . When I booked the apartment I asked for a late checkout and offered to pay a half day. I totally understand that the host is not required to honor that request and would have totally understood if I was given a no answer at check in I was told that it was not available but I checked Airbnb and there was a gap between my reservation and the next . Sure there could have been a reservation between mine but if that were the case the host could have told me earlier then 10 pm the night before checkout. She never really told me just sent a message asking what time i planned on leaving which really lead to an awkward conversation .

It was just as they described it on airbnb. Clean, comfy and with everything we needed. The location of the apartmemt was perfect. Close to the Metro-StationMONASTIRAKI and if you like to walk, all sightseeing-spots are really well to reach. In the neighborhood you can find very nice Cafes, Bars and Restaurants.
When we arrived Ailbhe was so nice to pick us up at the Metro-station. She was very nice an friendly and gave us a lot of informations and tips for Athens, wich we really appreciated.  Thanks a lot again for everything. "
201823,0,37,Self Enquiry,1,12,Male,2,1,Deluxe,5,5,3,1,20974,fog,"To sum up Ailbhe and Angels place, it was FANTASTIC! It sits on the edge of a small quite park in the Psyrri neighborhood. The apartment is exactly as they described and we were very comfortable our whole stay. They are courteous people with a friendly, helpful but non intrusive manner. I would highly recommend their space for your stay in Athens and give them huge praise for the welcome and kindness they show their guests!! I will preface this review by saying that I've been traveling six months in Europe, using AirB&B for much of my accommodation and write this because I've found an exemplary experience with these hosts. If you require more detail, read on... 5 day stay, June 2016 We had an early arrival with no expectation of being able to check in but were offered to drop our bags off so we could go site seeing without the hassle. This was a big relief for us. The space was very clean and uncluttered (this is high praise coming from me as I'm the type to notice the details). The newly renovated apartment provides for modern conveniences and a streamlined look of tidiness. We had every usual amenity at our fingertips and even an odd request I had for a particular item was met successfully and quickly at that. The apartment is light and airy with windows in each room or doors to the balcony looking out at the park, all making ventilation easy. The air conditioning was plenty sufficient for the space and the heatwave Greece was experiencing during our visit. We found every usable item to be in good working order so there was no concern or frustration with lack of maintenance on things provided for use. The wifi was an easy connect and plenty fast without dropping us on any device. The bed was wonderfully comfortable and I'd estimate about the size of an American queen. Each side with a bedside table and reading lamp and spacious enough around without fear of stubbing ones toes. The homeyness of the entire space was in having everything needed available but not an over personalized awkwardness that some places can have for the guest. With the late summer nightfall we rarely found ourselves out after dark but on the one evening we did, we felt no less safe than a wise tourist should be during the day. The apartment building is key locked at the main door which springs closed so access on premises was secure. The elevator worked fine at each use and was always available although the climb was not intense and I prefer the exercise. I didn't find noise to ever be a problem and never noticed unpleasant lingering odors common to multi family complexes. On the few occasions when messaging to ask questions, the response was rapid, concise and positive. In one situation when they'd come to drop off fresh linens for our long stay, they helped us to order in pizza since..."

The area right around the building isn't fantastic and it's a little bit of a walk to the nearest metro station, but not a problem for me; the cafe downstairs was nice and convenient. Noise wasn't any problem, but the unit is kind of bright in the mornings for a late sleeper. The only thing missing from the unit for me was some kind of coffee maker. There was a small glitch regarding arrival, because neither host was available during what I would think of as normal arrival time (mid-late afternoon), which I didn't know too much in advance, but that was worked out adequately, and Angel and Aibhe were great during my stay.

Pros: 
Extremely close toMONASTIRAKI Square which makes it very accessible when you are hauling around big bags from the airport. Perfectly safe to get back home late and the building has a security door downstairs. The doors of the apartment itself are built to high standards and have heavy duty bolts. Your belongings would be safe when you are roaming about town.
It has everything you would want - from a bottle of water in the fridge, iron, hairdryer, hot kettle, cookware, even tweezers, razor, makeup remover, cotton and earbuds. 
Panagiotis and his mother stay next door and can be reached anytime if you have a problem. The municipal body had turned off the Athens water supply for one entire day when we were there and our hosts helped us the best they could by providing water for drinking and for washing our hands. Early check-in is not an issue if guests from the earlier day have left early.
Cons:
This place has no windows but a big terrace at the back. This terrace has no views and is enclosed from all sides. We spent most of our time roaming around the city and this was not an issue for us. The place gets sufficient light from the doors opening up to the terrace. However, if you want a place with views of either the city streets or Acropolis, then this place is not for you.
Shower is a separate cubicle opening directly into the passage. This makes it a bit impractical since you have to hang your towel and clothes on the hook given outside the shower. It is ok if you are a couple but not advised for friends staying together who might need a bit more privacy. Toilet is separate with a basin but is extremely small as well.
There is no microwave oven. This is common throughout Greece though. You wouldn't find a microwave in any accommodation. There is an electric oven below the cooking range though.
AC system has only cooling, no heating- but to be fair, heating is not mentioned in their posting."

It is literally a less than 5-minute walk from the Larissa train station, which is the hub for several long-distant destinations. Phillippos' home was perfect for our two-night stay before heading to Meteora, Greece. I would absolutely recommend his place if you are looking for a place that is close to the train station, less than 15 minutes to downtown Athens, and that is in a safe location close to shops and a large supermarket. Thank you for a great experience."

The location is within a few minutes walk of the metro, and we used that extensively to get around town, which was very convenient. There is a farmers market twice a week half a block away where you can get all of the things you might want to cook at home, too. Having a washing machine allowed us to pack half the clothes we would have otherwise. This is an incredible value for your money, and I could not recommend it more highly."

The location is great. By staying out of the centre you get the chance to see parts of Athens you would otherwise miss, as you head for the Acropolis area.

So in terms of location, it really is excellent value for money as Athens is an expensive city for hotels. However, you *do* feel like your outside of the city centre as you have to cross a very busy intersection to get back to the flat and it’s very residential. So really depends on whether you want to be in the centre of things or in a quieter area.

Alex and Andrew run this as a business and are very good at communicating, very helpful but that means the apartment is lacking in character - it’s a bit sterile BUT it does have everything you could possibly need and there is a little balcony with a wonderful view of the Acropolis. I would say though that the stairwells in the apartment are very dark - lights didn’t seem to be working - so possibly less than ideal if you were travelling on your own. Although there always seem to be people around as there’s a little store downstairs and lots of men sitting around with coffees and beers.

Alex kindly arranged for a taxi to pick me up at the airport with a sign for 45EURO- unfortunately the taxi driver picked up someone else instead so I was left waiting for awhile before I took a city taxi (flat rate of 38EURO - so would recommend this option). It was a funny mishap though!

All in all I would say this place does the trick at a really good price. Walking distance of the centre and the attractions, view of the Acropolis, professional hosts etc."

It is a unit and noise travels. Neighbours seemed unaware of this and hence on occasion a bit noisy. Had to get up at 3 am  and ask them to be quiet. They were apologetic. In saying this it was two nights in two weeks there was an annoying problem. 

There is a supermarket nearby. You turn first left out the front door and it is on the opposite right hand corner.  

There is a fab cafe 50 m down towards the centre of town on the right on Ippokratous called Repeat. And a very cheap souvlaki down a bit further.

The balcony is really nica and refreshing. It's really nice to have breakfast and drink greek coffee in the mornings and drink beer at nights.

The landowner, Andrew is really helpful, not only in house matters, but in every aspect. He helped us a lot for exploring both Athens and Attica.

The bed and sofa are very comfy, and there's a lovely balcony that runs the full length of the flat, with a table and chairs and sofa, and lots of tall plants making it very private. There are also lights out there so you can enjoy it in the evenings. There's air con in the living room and a ceiling fan in the bedroom. 

Andrew is a great host and was very responsive and helpful, from booking to the trip itself, helping us out with any questions during our stay (such as transport queries) and flexible regarding check in and check out times. 

The only downside was the neighbourhood, which we didn't feel was very safe, particularly at night. The bigger streets around the flat don't have a very good vibe. I was staying with my husband and everything turned out ok, but if I had been on my own or with another female friend this would have been more of a problem. I would recommend using the Taxibeat app which Andrew recommended (similar to Uber), which avoids having to walk back at night or having any trouble with taxi drivers, and is also cheap.

She is really excellent at communications and I got her responses within an hour or two whenever there were inquiries. Due to the craziness of our summer overseas travel itineraries and also her indication of ""no charge for extra person,"" I mistakenly forgot mentioning the fact that there was one extra person flying in for the evening before our check-out, and she was very much understanding about it! 

It turned out that her place was her private residence for winter season so there was naturally a lot of her & family's personal stuff at the apartment, however it didn't bother us at all. In fact, it  sort of helped us feel at home. We stayed in and cooked several times because we had two senior parents who had a hard time walking in the heat, and her kitchen was just perfect for family meals! And she left us a bottle of wine, too!  

Just a friendly advice for those who do not care about not having air-conditioners but hate mosquitos, you need to get your repellent or mosquito swatter for this place. Her apt was on the top floor with a rooftop, but mosquitos still reached up there and savaged me! "

Avoid the run of eateries en route to Acropolis. Food ok but overpriced. Head the other way, eat with Athenians at Vanilla bistro, To Kati Anno ( fab salads, good souvlaki), also mezze ..can't recall the name .? Well it's next to Vanilla...And go to the Friday fresh foods market in Zaharista (sugar) Street.  Some good local bakeries down that way.  Walk the path around the Acropolis and down through the stalls at Thissio, maybe lunch overlooking ruins on Adrianou but choose a place with local clientele and don't forget to share dishes and flavours.  The flat has wonderfully big comfortable beds and pillows, good linen. Lovely light airy curtains so maybe an eye mask helpful in summer! "

It seemed to be in walking distance of everything and it sure was! Note to future stayers, bring comfy running shoes and a backpack to enjoy all day. 

What we didn't expect was the shower being very small... I guess it bothered me more since I'm 6'4. I'm just used to bigger showers in the states. Also, the pipes are older in the city so FYI bring medical gloves and some scented bags due to not flushing toilet paper down the toilet. It's not a vacation ruiner, but I am sure it would bother some people. Just a little note... To take a shower and want hot/warm water you have to turn a switch and wait about 20 minutes and then turn it off and shower. It runs out quick so it'll be a bootcamp kind of shower... Get in and get out! 

The only issue I would really stress is the noise level... Bear in mind, we are light sleepers, but the noise level from upstairs, downstairs, the outside street and the pub that's just outside the balcony down the street can keep you up all night. We go to sleep early and wake up early to beat the crowds of people at attractions so again, the noise issue is concerning. 

The location overall is perfect. You can easily walk to Acropolis,PLAKA, and all of the main sites to see! I highly recommend to book a get off and get on your bus. We paid around 18 euros or so for multiple lines for two days and saw everything. 

Food: Shop local, literally! Go buy your food at a supermarket. The downside is hardly anyone knows English. It'll also be super cheaper! Using little stores like okay go anytime markets can be very expensive! And the food selection is horrible. It's like a Walgreens-7/11 comparison wise. 

Again, this was our first time in Athens and actually using AirBnB. I would recommend her place, but it's not for 'everyone'.

The only reason I can't give this home a total 5 is because of the neighborhood.  It's close to the Kato Patissia metro stop, which is great, but the neighborhood itself is pretty dirty, stinky, and generally questionable.  We often found upwards of 20 young men openly drinking cheap beer on the corner a block away.  But to be fair, it is Athens, a major sprawling capital.  I'm sure Washington D.C. has questionable areas, too.  If you plan on taking the metro in and out each day then it's probably fine."

When we arrived in Athens, Gerasimos was not in the country but he was available at any time to communicate with us through Airbnb messages, he is very responsive and he arranged to have the mother of a friend of his to open the apartment for us. Pay attention to the door as it locks automatically, so make sure you have the key when you leave the apartment and most important double check to not have a key in the door inside, as you will not be able to go in anymore. We went through that and after that episode, we only had 1 key for 2 couples with different schedules so it was challenging to synchronize our plans.

The apartment is located near (3-4 minutes) the metro station Kato Patisia (green line). From there you can go anywhere, from the city center (about 7-10 minutes toMONASTIRAKI) up to the Piraeus port (about 20 minutes). In the neighborhood, you will find supermarkets, a few restaurants to eat or some small markets if you want to buy something quick.

Obviously, the balcony is the biggest plus of the apartment. It is huge and you can enjoy your breakfast there, as you will find a table for 6-8 persons outside and 2 chairs, but you can take some more from the inside, as you have plenty. If you want to stay in the house during the day it might get a little bit noisy as it is located near to a playground area, but if you are there to visit the city it will not affect you at all. 

You will find in the apartment a big fridge where you can leave your food or drinks, the kitchen is equipped with plates, cups, glasses, pots, and cutlery. We also find a sandwich maker but it was pretty old and it really didn't look that good to try it.

Regarding the bedrooms, they are big, well lighted with comfy bed, at least the one that we have tried :P. We had some drawers to put our clothes inside, but I would recommend to clean off the dust to avoid surprises.  You will find additional blankets if you are cold. There are an iron and a hairdryer as well for you to use.

In which concerns the 2 bathrooms, note that only one has a shower, the other one is just to use the toilet. Regarding the toilet, we felt the need to buy a chlorine product to disinfect them. You will find soap and toilet paper (just one per bathroom, no extra) and 2 towels, one big and one small, per person.

Gerasimos come on our last day to make the checkout. He didn't want to disturb us so he waited in the hall, I find that very nice of him, even though it wasn't necessary.

All of these qualities were important to me because I lived there for one month while taking an intensive study course about a ten minute walk toward the city center.  I wanted to be comfortable in the flat while I spent my spare time studying on evenings and weekends.

The bedrooms are pretty good. The mattresses are very comfortable. The showers are a little small but good. It maybe good to bring your toiletries like shower gel and shampoo etc. The towels and sheets are good. 

The kitchen is well stocked and Dionysios and Ilaria left us some food and fruit to get started. We were able to eat breakfast at home on all days and one day we made dinner too. There is a grocery store within walking distance and you can stock up easily. 

Overall a wonderful experience and would certainly recommend staying here. This was our very first experience using AirBnb and we were very happy with the overall experience. "

The hosts do a great job of checking in with you and making sure the kitchen is stocked with essentials and breakfast/snack foods. They even helped me with transportation arrangements!

202797,0,38,Self Enquiry,1,13,Male,3,3,Deluxe,5,6,3,2,24652,rain,"We couldn't provide a stronger recommendation for staying at Dionysios' place. Everything about it -- from the house itself, to Dionysios and Ilaria as hosts, to  the neighborhood -- is perfect. 

The house: The pictures accurately depict what you should expect. The swimming pool, in fact, is much larger than what we expected in the photos. We arrived at the apartment and everything was very clean and there were extra touches from the host throughout -- plenty of linens, toiletries in the bathrooms, food stocked in the kitchen, etc. There is so much outdoor space, between the courtyard in the back, the two roof terraces, and the balconies which are all beautifully decorated with flowers and plants. 

One tip: If you are planning to need the fourth bedroom (located in the guest house), double check with Dionysios that it is available as it was under renovation during our stay. However, the three available bedrooms, three bathrooms (including one in the pool area), and two half bathrooms are more than adequate for most groups. 

Hosts: Dionysios and Ilaria met us upon arrival, gave us a tour of the home, and gave us tips about the neighborhood and other locations throughout Athens. They also offered to arrange a taxi pickup at the airport to make arrival easy. Dionysios also stopped by a few times during our stay to make sure we were comfortable and enjoying ourselves. In conversation, we mentioned that we wanted to learn more about Greek wines/spirits and that we were enjoying the seafood in Athens. Over the next two days, he stopped by with wine, a mystery Greek alcohol, three beautiful fresh fish, and octopus! Very thoughtful and great hospitality! 

The neighborhood: 15 minute walk to Placa/Acropolis and Syntagma Square.  We love walking so it was easy to get to all of our destinations on foot. Within the neighborhood is just about everything you might need -- restaurants, cafes, bars, grocery stores, pharmacies, etc. Mets (the neighborhood) has a cool vibe and the people are laid back, young, and very friendly. Mets is also very green and quiet which sets it apart from many other Athens neighborhoods. 

Thanks again Dionysios for a lovely stay! "

Dionysios went over and above . He discussed tour and food options. If we had any questions, he responded within minutes.

Most of the furniture was made by the owner himself, as he is a furniture designer.  The greatest asset of this rental was the owner, Dionysios.  He went above and beyond our expectations.  We were a group of 8 and the house was perfect for us.  Dionysios loaded the kitchen with food that we had requested.  He also arranged transportation from the airport for all of us.  We initially were all going to arrive in Athens at the same time, however, due to airline delays, our group arrived over 3 days.  Dionysios immediately sprang into action and picked up my sister, who was traveling alone and arrived first.  He then sent a driver for the rest of us over the next couple of days.  The airlines lost our luggage and instead of wasting a day sitting in the house waiting for delivery of our luggage, Dionysius collected it for us and had it waiting in the house when we returned from sightseeing.  Simply put, Dionysius, went out of his way to make our first trip to Athens memorable, despite the negative experience we had with the airlines. The house is in Kallimamaro district, nearby the Panathenaic Stadium.  The Acropolis was a short 15 minute walk.  There are many food options and shops within a 5 minute walk.  It was very easy to communicate with Dionysius, via (Hidden by Airbnb) while in Athens, and if we needed anything, he would be at our door in 5 minutes.  Thank You Dionysius!!!"

the host, Dion, is the best guy you could meet in Greece, probably in the world , without any exaggeration. he was of amazing help, extra-ordinary company, we enjoyed the chats, the recommendations, the food. we felt the essence of what it means to be welcomed to someone's home, we felt home away from home, Dion is so amazing that we will visit him whenever we're in greece whether we're staying at his amazing house or not.
if you are looking for a genuine greek airbnb experience, this is the place to be, you will go home with a great friend, not an airbnb host.

The location of the house was a joy as it was right by many of the ancient structures (like the temple of Athena, the temple of Zeus, the first modern Olympic stadium and the first modern theatre). The house was amazing for kids as it had a swimming pool and a variety of instruments to play around with. Since it is a 4 bedroom house it is more than enough for a family to fit in. Dionysus is a kind man who will help you pick the best restaurants and help plan your day ahead. We were glad to stay in the Air BNB and we would recommend it to anyone who wants to seek adventure in the city of Greece.

From Helen and Martyn (mum and dad)

This is the best Air BNB we have ever stayed in, by a long way. The photos you see here don't begin to do the place justice: it's fun, funky, well-equipped and in a fantastic location, within walking distance of the stadium, Acropolis, parliament, park and some of the best restaurants in the city. The swimming pool is a real bonus - we were in it every day for at least an hour. As for Dion: he is a kind, thoughtful, pro-active and customer-focused gentleman who will bend over backwards to ensure you have the very best possible stay.

First floor: Nice living room and well equipped kitchen (both equipment and stuff for cooking).  Video of street outside from each direction. 
Below that: A large indoor heated pool, with shower and toilet adjacent to it!  Exits onto a lovely patio area with small basketball hoop,  and adjacent small extra building (suitable for one or two people; good for someone who wants to be apart from the rest of the group). 

Second floor: Two very comfortable bedrooms with air conditioning, one very large and the other perfectly adequate size. Each has a nice bathroom.  Also a washing machine, and a large rack for drying the clothes after they are washed (no dryer). 
Top floor takes the cake for uniqueness: Bedroom with in room sink and toilet, and shower outside (would not recommend use during the day; it is visible from some adjacent buildings). A very serene and calm patio with very comfortable furniture near to the shower. 

The location is convenient—about a 10-15 drive from the Acropolis area. 

The owner, Dionysios, designed and built this property, and he clearly loves. He is very interesting to talk to; very much enjoyed talking to him. He kindly had fruit waiting for us, and gave a bottle of wine gratis. He lives right across the street. 

What could be better?: Master bedroom AC is a little noisy, and need to provide instructions on how to use the satellite TV (not a big deal for our two night stay, but would be helpful to have more viewing options).

The location couldn't be more central and provide everything that a person would need while visiting and exploring Athens. The metro station is literally around the corner from the apartment and the police headquarters are right next door providing the utmost security! You don't get that in many places. This listing is surrounded by shops, cafes, restaurants, public transport, very close proximity to the city centre, supermarkets etc. I can't praise this listing and Diana enough! This listing and host would have to be undoubtedly one of the best on the airbnb site!"

It is located in a safe residential neighborhood with wonderful tavernas (cafes), restaurants, bakeries, and shops within two blocks. Two supermarkets provide great Greek cheeses, olive oil and basic necessities nearby. A Saturday market offers fresh fruits and vegetables, fresh fish, inexpensive clothes, and home made wine and olive oil along with a purely Greek local experience. The area is SAFE! The main police station is on the same block as the apartment and the police are polite and courteous. In the evenings the streets are packed with locals going out for coffee or drinks on the main road - Alexandras Street. The cafes serve drinks and it is perfectly acceptable for both men and women to enjoy them solo. All have glass or plastic covered porches extending out onto the street and heated in the winter, so they are fantastic places to people watch. The metro is a short half block away and goes directly to the Acropolis, Monasteraki, the Agora,PLAKA and Keramicos. In the opposite direction, a 36 minute ride takes you to the airport - convenient and economical! Buses and trams go to the old Olympic stadia and other parts of town. The apartment has a spacious living room where my grandson slept, a large bedroom with a very comfortable ergonomic queen bed, kitchen and good sized bathroom. Two sides open out onto a wrap around verandah through large french doors which can be shuttered in the night to block out the street lights. It is newly renovated so it has a bright fresh feel and all the linens, bedding, towels etc. are superbly clean and perfectly arranged. On the third floor, there is a rooftop verandah with a breathtaking view of the city toward the North, where in the warmer months one can take meals and just lounge. I was there in late November which was a bit chilly for outdoor eating. The WIFI is good and there is a print and copy shop a few blocks away where you can take any work you need printed on a data stick. I spent three weeks here while doing research and it was comfortable and delightful. For almost two weeks I had a teenage grandson with me and he enjoyed the place as well. We went out daily to explore the ancient city and in the evenings delighted in the local cuisine and pastry shops. The kitchen is adequate but the local restaurants provide great home cooked style meals which you can take home or even order in by phone if you wish. However, Greeks are very social and the evenings are not to be missed in the cafes and restaurants. Also, many restaurants have a light home made ""house"" wine without a specific vintage, but which makes a traditional local complement to the savory foods. I suggest people go beyond the highly commercialized Giros and Souvlakia and try to various..."

There are so many positive things to say about his place. Let’s go down the list: 1) Location: This apartment is located in the center ofKOLONAKI, in Athens. Don’t let the word “center” fool you into thinking it’s loud and muggy. Although it’s located in a busy area such asKOLONAKI, the street itself is quaint and quiet. The neighborhood is extremely safe, lots of trees, couples walking their dogs at night, elderlies smiling and nodding at you as you walk pass them on the sidewalk, the waitress from the coffee shop down the street will learn your name the first day and greet you as you walk pass them every time. It feels like walking into the 2001 Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s Amelie movie set. It’s conveniently located 2 blocks from the Evengelismo metro station, where you can just hop on and connect anywhere in the city (2 stops from Acropolis- 6 mins). It’s the perfect area in every way. 2) The Apartment: This apartment is flawless. Gheorghos is a man who pays attention to details. The apartment is spacious, comfortable lighting, quiet, and just by sitting in the room. The apartment is immaculate. Bathroom and kitchen has been disinfected and I didn’t even see any water stains on the glass. There are two massive rooms, both with air conditioning units. The master bedroom is separated from the living room by a set of French doors for privacy. The guest bedroom is on the other side of the apartment, which also has its own private entrance. Both rooms and the living room have its own designated entrances to the balcony. The balcony is my favorite part of this apartment. Gheorghos has completely renovated this balcony with columns, plants and herbs, and peaceful lighting. There’s a round table and chairs out there where I enjoyed a wonderful quiet evening by drinking a beer, and thought about the busy day I had exploring the city of Athens. It was a perfect little spot to conclude my chaotic day and recharge my energy. 3) The Host: Gheorghos is well educated, intelligent, and charismatic. His optimism and positive energy is contagious, which also makes him very approachable. He understands his clients’ needs and his customer service is top notch. He lives right next door to this apartment so he is accessible if you need anything, but he also understands that his clients need their privacy so unless you need him, you will not hear nor see him at all. I felt safe and at peace knowing he is next door if I need anything. In conclusion, this apartment and its host are perfect for anyone visiting Athens. Moving forward, every time I visit Athens from now on, I will stay here. Knowing this place exist, I will..."

We just realized the chance we've got by staying in this area because we almost came back after midnight. And there is security, everywhere  there are guards.
Gheorghos is somebody very humble. He does not want to describe more the area where his appartment is located. He prefers to surprise his guests.

The house has been restyled with a heart and care for beauty . You can feel this , being there.
The atmosphere of the house and building , immediately give you a good and calm feeling entering it. What else does one need after travelling or visiting the buzzing metropole Athens?
The feeling of home, where you feel safe and sains.

During the reservation , some time for arrival , we had already a nice contact with Georghos, who told us about the house and its history.
The contact became even better as we arrived and met Georghos, an open and warm-hearted guy.

Being art- , design -and museumlovers the appartment was well situated ; Many of the cultural places could be reached by feet.
If not , it is easy to take a taxi or the metro, which next to this  , can bring you straight to the airport if needed.
Also from the trainstation , with one switch at stop 'Syntagma' , it's very easy to reach by metro. 
To be honest we were sorry that we couldn't stay longer in this cosy place, but being adventurous travellers , the next destination was calling us already .
And having our rest during our stay at Gheorghos' , we were able to climb mountains... 
For sure we recommand Gheorgos place  highly. 
It's more then worth being here.

It was so close that we were always able to come back for a afternoon nap after a long day and go back in the evening.
We got around using taxis as they were so cheap.

His apartment was as described - modern, comfortable, clean, and in the perfect location. You can walk the entire city of Athens from there. 

Where Miltos really stood out was in customer service. He met me at the Metro stop around 10:30pm on a weeknight to let me into the apartment and help me get situated. He explained everything about the apartment in detailed and showed me on a map where I should go and do in town. Miltos was extremely helpful with communication throughout the trip. In fact, my trip to Meteora would have been ruined but for the fact that Miltos advised me there was a Metro strike and I would have to get a taxi to the train station about an hour early because of strike-related traffic. I made my train with 10 minutes to spare and would not have made it without him. Finally, Miltos scheduled a cab for me to the airport at 5:00am on the day of my departure. He made the entire stay extremely easy. I would give him 10 stars if I could."

We stayed in the most spectacular location both in terms of access to the major sites of Athens and in terms of the beauty; we had a fantastic time. 

It was also a major help when Miltos took some time out to study the map of Athens with us detailing everything that we had to see if we wanted a mind blowing Athens experience. Every single thing he recommended far exceeded expectations and this seems to be something that is consistent in everything about Miltos. 

I would highly recommend staying with Miltos if you have the opportunity. "

1. LOCATION. Seriously you couldn't ask for a better place to be to see the sites of Athens. The Acropolis is out your window and you are in the heart of thePLAKA neighborhood. We walked to everything very easily. The metro is maybe a 5 minute walk, lots of shops and restaurants as well. There really isn't a better central location to be to get to all the historic sites and explores Athens. 
2. ACCOMMODATIONS. The apartment is stylishly decorated with lots of extras like extra bedding, pillows, dishes, hairdryer, cleaning supplies and more. There is also a roll down security shade on the outside windows but honestly we felt so safe we used it more to keep the sun out so it would stay a little cooler while we were away. The bed was very comfy and the kitchen was well appointed to be able to cook meals if you want to pick up some fresh foods at the local market. 
3. EXTRAS. Their are too large TVs, and a music system.  Their is also wifi but it is not very fast--however we experienced the same slowness at every place in Greece so I don't think this is unique to the apartment. The neighborhood was very safe and the people are very kind and welcoming. If you want a gelato at midnight take about 20 steps out your front door and enjoy!

It is very clean and equipped with a comfortable lounge, nice sized kitchen and bathroom. It has air conditioning in both the living area and the bedroom and is great whether one be seeking some solitude or whether one be seeking to get out and explore Athens. 

The roller blinds  are really handy, making the place dark so one can enjoy the Athenian nightlife and still get a great sleep. 

There, however, are three standout features of this property:-

1. Miltos was the perfect host. Apart from the usual things he sent an extensive list of tourist tips well before we arrived that we could research,  assisted with our transport to and from the  property,  greeted us and thoroughly explained how to use the property, provided us with a map and suggestions, assisted with dinner reservation etc.

2. The property was perfectly located. it is about one shop away from the main tourist market area, about 2 shops away from a major tavern area and a great bar and roof top cinema, about 100m away from  the Ancient Agoras, Acropolis gates, the Acropolis museum, Lisiou street,  and even closer to the Arch of Hadrian and the Temple of Zeus. 

3. Despite being well located the property is remarkably quiet we did not hear any noise, day or night, during our stay.

203088,0,32,Self Enquiry,1,18,Male,3,4,Basic,3,5,3,2,21034,rain,"This vacation was truly memorable and made so by our host, Miltos. He arranged transportation for us to and from the airport and to and from the port for a couple of days on Hydra while Athens was in the middle of a taxi strike. This was certainly helpful given the situation which could have made our time here quite challenging. The tips and suggestions of sites to see, places to eat and shops to visit was all over and above expectations. 

The apartment is lovely, modern and very clean.   The king size bed was very comfortable. The setting is close to everything yet has a neighborhood feel with everyone we encountered being friendly and helpful. A very safe area with a charm that is amazing including the many people that we met. There is even a gelato stand around the corner that is better than the others in the area. Make sure you check it out. 

We would highly recommend staying in one of Miltos’s properties and if we could provide a 10 star rating we certainly would.

Eleni was indeed a very kind host, very intellectual and nice person to interact!

Eleni's flat is very spacious and has all essential amenities. Big plus is the unlimited round-the-clock supply of hot water (as in most other flats we had to switch on the heater and waited for some time).
The flat is about 10 mins walking distance fromAGIOS KONSTANTINOS - PL. VATHI - AGIOS PAVLOS metro station, which is just 1 stop away from the centralMONASTIRAKI station. We used this location to explore this side of Athens such as Mount Lycabettus which is in close proximity. Also it is within 5 minutes walking distance to the National Archeological Museum, which is just 2-3 blocks away. This is a big plus.
Objectively speaking though, the neighbourhood looks edgy. Provocative graffitis/slogans/posters are rampant in nearby buildings. There is a square about 100 metres from the building, where refugees gather at day and night. We could see fires lit up and hear indistinct music at night at the square. Eleni explains that this is an area where many liberals and intellectuals live and despite the apparent edginess, it is still safe. This could be true as we do see Greeks carry on with their normal activities. However it does make us the holiday goers feel tense when coming back late at night."

The apartment is a sanctuary from the busy city, light and airy, with comfortable furniture, both a place to relax, be inspired, and get your work done. If you like to cook, there is a lovely rustic kitchen with majestic ceilings, stone walls, stove and state of the art refrigerator. Within walking distance, you will find a supermarket, bakery, butcher shop, and a series of smaller shops selling organic vegetables, homemade products and delicacies (including the best olives in the world!).

Exarchia is for book lovers (readers and writers), it is stuffed with bookstores and book publishers, amidst rebellious and alternative cultures, a utopian spirit permeates the quarter.

The place was very clean and modern in an okay location but we had a massive inconvenience with check-in.  There was no arrival information including the address, provided.  We had to request it. We originally were told 2pm was ok.  Then we got a note and asked if we could be there by 1.  We rushed across the city and were told we could leave our bags but not get into the room until they finished some maintenance.  We were all in need of a rest and instead had to go out for the day with no shower.  They did call us around 4:30 to let us know it was ready and it was nice they brought up the bags for us.  Our previous place said we could have a late check out so this totally put a damper on the last day of our trip.  Instead of offering a discount for the problem, I was told that ""This was a luxury apartment, not a cheap hotel, and that this was the price to pay,"" as if we have never stayed somewhere nice before. It could have been a bit of language barrier but I have to say we were all, including my native Greek-speaking friend, a bit insulted. We were much happier in our €74/night place the night before.  (Actually, this was the least favorite of three Airbnbs of the whole trip.) Furthermore, both beds were awful.  There was a huge lump in the middle of the king size bed and the mattress was quite thin.  We all slept terribly. Also, our plans changed and we switched from two to a party of four.  It was not a good place for four.  Two would be the max based on the layout.  The unit pictured was completely different in layout, although the same style, than the one we were given.  I must say the rooftop patio and jacuzzi were breathtakingly beautiful but we did not get a chance to enjoy them due to the inconvenience mentioned earlier--we were too tired!  One final problem:  You cannot flush the paper anywhere in Greece but this was the only place that provided a trash bin with no lid...  Odd!  As an AirBNB host myself,  feel bad for leaving such a negative review but want to be honest about the experience for the integrity of the AirBNB community."

Tip for visiting The Acropolis: wake early to beat the crowds! This apartment is so close, that you can! Try to arrive at 8:00 in the morning when it opens, there's a lovely coffee shop a few doors down from the apartment on the way to the site, you can grab a coffee and snack to eat before, visit The Acropolis, return to Lena's apartment for breakfast/lunch, and then go on with the rest of you day."

Argiro and Panos were super hosts, ready to answer to every question at any given moment. They even provided us coffee, honey, bread, candies, chocolate :) They went further to recommend us eating and sightseeing options for Crete, our next destination after Athens.

Another bonus is represented by the neighbourhood. Panormou station is located on the metro line to/from the airport and just 4 stops to Syntagma. Extremely safe area and so many eating options where you don't get the feeling of being tourist but a local. Most of the restaurants are opened till late night.

It is slightly smaller but even nicer and cosier than it looks on the photos. Even in one of the coldest weather one could probably get in Athens, it was possible to heat it up to a comfortable temperature. The wifi is fast and the kitchen well enough equipped to whip up some simple breakfast and meals. That said, one would hardly ever get tempted to eat in considering all the great and affordable food options around. There are several small cafes/bars that serve decent mezze, a few great take-away places and even some wonderful restaurants. And that's just the immediate neighbourhood!
One of the great discoveries of our trip was that Athens is actually a very walkable city and Anna's apartment is very well located to reach most of the interesting neighbourhoods within a 20-30 min walk. It is easy to make the best of your time in Athens staying at this place and Anna is also full of lots of amazing tipps making Tripadvisor, Lonely Planet, etc. pretty much obsolete.

203897,0,37,Self Enquiry,3,18,Female,4,5,Deluxe,3,6,1,2,25330,rain,"+ Close to public transit. The M3 (Kerameikos station) which goes to the airport is a 5-10 min walk away. The M1 (Thissio station) which goes to Piraeus port is a 15 min walk away. We flew in and took the ferry out, so this was perfect.

+ Close to the sights while still quiet. The Acropolis, Filopappou Hill, andMONASTIRAKI are within a 30 min walk. The flat is nestled just a few blocks back from the main streets, so it is quiet. Very little car traffic. Some noise from the bars and cafe on the street, but being on the top floor, you can easily shut it out by closing the windows. The only noise we couldn't fully block out was a barking dog, which seems kind of ubiquitous in Greece (every place we stayed seemed to have a barking dog in the neighborhood, haha).

+ Super hip and local. The area is not frequented by tourists, but there are several shops-- cafes, bars, restaurants, retail-- and it is fairly lively with locals who are in the know for good spots. Elvis Kalamaki, right around the corner, which Anna recommended, was the best souvlaki we had the entire trip, and we ate a lot.

+ Modern and fully-equipped flat. Clean and solid tiling throughout, fridge, hot plates, microwave, bathroom with separated shower (which some Athens flats don't have), two balconies, a large, comfy bed, and an elevator. It's a studio, so for 1-2 people, it is perfect. Wifi was excellent, great strength and consistent, which we needed.

It does have the usual quirks of Greece-- toilet paper cannot be flushed and must be thrown in the trash; water must be heated before taking a shower. This was the case everywhere we stayed.

+ Attentive and friendly host! Anna maintained great communication throughout, gave us a warm welcome and orientation to the city, and sent a message to check in every day. This is not the illegal hostel treatment that you get from a lot of hosts who are permanently ""on vacation"" and can't meet you. Anna puts a lot of care into taking care of the flat and the visitor. We had a really great time, and hope to have a nice drink together the next time too."

The street that the apartment is on is less touristy and is clearly where the local Athenians go. The cafes and bars were all interesting- I wish I had more time to explore them. The absolute highlight for me were the amazing hosts- Anna and Popi. I had read in other reviews about how nice they were, and they truly are the loveliest women! They were so friendly, welcoming, interesting! I happened to arrive on a night they were free, so they showed me around the neighborhood and gave me all the best local tips. I highly recommend a nearby cafe/restaurant they showed me called Mpempa owned by their friend who is a fantastic chef.

First, communication was very clear leading up to our arrival, and that was very helpful as we were arriving from Italy and didn't always have excellent internet access. Anna sent very accurate descriptions about the different ways to get to her place from the airport, and we opted to take the metro and it was not only inexpensive, but very quick and convenient. Her place is a short walk (even with luggage and on a hot day) from the metro station, and we didn't have to transfer trains from the airport, which made the trip quite stress free. Anna and Poppi were waiting for us at the apartment to let us in and show us around, and after we had a chance to settle in, we met them downstairs at a cafe for a drink and they took us on a tour of the Neighborhood, giving us tips on where to eat, how to get to different attractions and really tailored their suggestions based on what we are interested in. There's a reason Anna is a Super Host! Although this was our first trip to Athens, we felt at home straight away thanks to Poppi and Anna's warmth and hospitality. The apartment is accurately depicted. Actually, it's a bit more spacious than the pictures suggest. One balcony gets beautiful bright morning light, and the other gets the evening light. We got take out one night at ate outside overlooking the city and it was beautiful. The apartment has all the things you need - a well appointed bathroom, all the kitchen essentials including a full size fridge. You *could* cook if you really wanted to, but I don't know why you would want to. The area if full of really good and affordable dining options. There's an elevator, and very fast reliable wifi and a highly efficient air conditioner for those hot days. We were also thankful for a clothing rack so we could do some hand washing. The clothes we put out in the evening were dry by morning. This was a huge bonus for us since we're traveling for over three weeks. The location of Anna's place is great. It's outside the very touristy areas, but all the sights are within easy access. One thing I want to note: Please consider coming to Athens for more than a quick overnight on your way to the islands. Athens is an amazing city full of contradictions. If you come just to visit the Acropolis, you're missing out. Athens is an ancient city with a long memory and a lot of history, but it's also a thriving modern metropolis with art, culture, energetic youth, music, food, and shopping to explore, and Anna and Poppi are the best ambassadors to welcome you.

The hosts, especially Giannis and Lilly were fenomenal. I didn't really spend much time with Mimis the landlord. Rooms and bathrooms were very clean. The upper level bathroom was quite spacious and comfortable. The lower level rooms are very small and old and are separated from each other by an old door that's locked. Obviously there isn't much privacy between those two rooms. The noise coming from the street (motorcycles, barking dogs, and drunken people) will make it difficult for you to sleep, at least in the aforementioned rooms. If you are a light sleeper, elder, or anybody else, I recommend against taking the first two rooms as you may not get much of a sleep there, if any at all. That's due to both the location of the apartment and the poor insulation of the windows and floors. And, actually, to the mores of Athenians too. But if you only have a day or two in Athens, this would be a great choice to explore everything around the historical center. And the hosts are really really nice too."

The house was really cool and old and had other rooms for rent. We slept with the window open and were not bothered by any outside noise. Giannis was lovely and very kind (offered us some chocolates), and the bathroom, though shared, was very clean. That being said we had two major issues with our stay. The first was check-in. I communicated with the host that our arrival was delayed and when we expected to arrive. She said that someone would be there at the appointed time, however when we arrived, no one answered the door despite ringing the bell multiple times. A bit panicked, we carried our heavy bags back up to a nearby restaurant we had passed and begged to use their wifi and phone, as we were from the states and no able to use our cell phones to call the number provided. No one answered our multiple messages or calls, so we walked back to try the bell one more time. As we were turning to leave and find a cafe to sit in and wait for a response to our messages, Giannis casually walked up to let us in. Although it all worked out, being in a different country and not being able to communicate easily with our phones, and not having our host be there when we expected him, was very stressful. On top of that, the listing clearly stated that there was air-conditioning, however there was only a fan in the room. We were there during a heat wave, so it was hotter than normal, but for this reason we had even double checked the listing to make sure there was a/c. We would not have booked this room if we had known it didn't have it. We ended up sleeping with wet towels over us to try to keep us cool, and didn't sleep well at all. If you are not traveling in the summer months, it won't matter, and the room was fine otherwise, but I would recommend double checking the amenities with the host prior to booking. I showed the host the listing where it stated there was a/c, so hopefully she will update it."

The word ""historic"" makes the place sound just outdated; it's so much more than that. What a unique place with so much personality at an amazing location especially for a budget traveler. Super close to the metro station that links to the port, airport, and train station if you're going outside Athens. They provide you a little handbook with good places to eat and have fun in the area. Since it's a shopping area, you see more locals than tourists.

The place was clean -- had a little bit of smell probably from the old hardwood floor but that comes with the age of the building. Towels were soft -- a strange thing to talk about, right? So far, half of the 4 Airbnb locations we've stayed in Greece had sandpaper-feel towels cuz air drying is common. The streets are well lit and super safe. It's close to taverns, but not right in front of it so noise was minor (granted it was a Thursday night). The room doesn't have an AC but a window and a fan, so it does get a bit hot. Might not be the best choice if you absolutely need it to be cold to fall asleep.  The rooftop is really cute to enjoy cool air at night.

When we got back several hours later, our bags had been moved into our room and our coats had been hung up on the rack--too kind! They even provide a little homemade booklet full of their favorite spots around town to get you started on your own explanation. The whole house is available to you should you want to use it...if all that doesn't say enough, I couldn't recommend this place more highly. It will be the first place I check should I ever come back to Athens. Peace and love! Long live Betty!"

However, I always find honest reviews helpful and I try to do so on my own too. I hope my review could be some help for future guests considering to stay at this accommodation.  

Good:
- Affordable: I stayed in November for 7 nights, so it was largely due to off peak price and weekly discount
- Spacious: There is even a second bedroom with 2 single beds (No photo at the time of writing this review)
- Nice neighbourhood/Good access to city centre: The flat situates close to Exarcheia, a very lively hipster neighbourhood of Athens. Also it is walking distance to central Athens like Syntagma sq (although it is slightly uphill to come back)

Not good:
- Very Noisy: It is on the ground floor facing a very busy street with constant traffic (it is one of the few streets which crosses the hill straight away, so cars and motorcycles are coming and going from early morning till late at night). You can still hear some noise after closing outside-blinds and windows completely, as well as using ear plugs. Not recommended for light sleepers, or those who feel stressed of hearing constant traffic noise at the flat in the daytime. 
- Dark and Wet: Since it is so noisy outside, you do not want to open the windows, which makes the air stuck/humid, as the windows are only on the street side. Also, the sun does not come into the flat much, so it is generally dark unless you turn on lights. 
- Cold, No AC and no working Heater: Amenities list includes heating but they are not working. Since the flat does not have much sunlight and the air stays in, it was rather cold in the room (sometimes colder than outside). Most of the central heaters were taken away (only small heaters in the 2nd bedroom and kitchen, which were not working anyway). I called Airbnb regarding this point, and they provided me some money to purchase an electronic heater to help my situation. 
- Not enough Essentials: Despite some photos include essentials such as bed linens and toilet papers, this was not included in amenities list. Although the host ended up providing most of the essentials, she only provided one bath towel for 2 people and only one bed sheet and duvet cover for 7 nights stay. There is a washer but wet clothes didn't dry easily in the air-stuck/wet/cold rooms. It would have been nicer to have one more pair of those items for 2 people for 7 nights, but again the host told me that they were not included from the beginning anyway.  

Overall, I think the flat is reasonably priced and the host seemed nice, but considering the negative points I had to bear during my stay, I don't think I would look for an elsewhere even if it is a bit more expensive. "

While we never actually met Stayros, we were greeted by his wife who showed us around the house and made sure we had everything we needed, this went above and beyond our normal Airbnb expectation.

This is a fully stocked apartment, when we arrived there was no laundry soap, but it was immediately replaced to make sure we had everything we needed (we desperately needed to do our laundry).  We arrived to a fridge stocked with lunch meat, cheese, juice, and fresh bread on the counter.  There is a full, small kitchen.

The listing says there is only one bedroom, but the living room has a bed and a door, so it's basically a two bedroom apartment.  The AC kept the place cool even in 104 / 40 degree weather.  There is in fact WiFi, it must have been fixed since the previous review, and it is reasonably fast (5-8 Mb/s).

It is a 20 minute bus ride or a 3 euro uber to the city center.  The neighborhood is full of stores and a few restaurants, it is somewhat residential but not far away from the center of Athens.

The apartment sits straight across from the Arch of Hadrian and the Temple of Zeus - an amazing sight that dominates the outlook from the apartment.

We thought it was a coincidence that we had just happened to choose an artist's apartment. Maybe it was...but we like to think that the apartment is a reflection of the spirit of Athens itself. Athens today is like Paris of the 1950s...a haven for artists as yet unrecognized by the world.

As for our host, Renos and his mother were amazing! They responded quickly to messages, both before and during my stay. They were also very accommodating and hospitable. My flight got in early the day of my arrival and Renos and his mother were able to meet me at the apartment right away. When the small stove stopped working, they got a full stove and oven for the apartment and when there was an issue with the shower, they quickly got the issue resolved (shower hose/head got replaced, works great!). As I was living in a foreign country for awhile, they made the experience less stressful and I always felt that they were there to take care of things.

It's in the very city center (5'-7' from Omonia metro station), so it's easy to walk everywhere but the seaside - it's about 20' walking to Syntagma orMONASTIRAKI (the central squares). There are lots of cafes, a pharmacy and a supermarket in the same building. Also there is a open cinema close to the house.
The neighborhood is not the best since there are many anarchists and they are in the street 24/7, but they seem to be calm and quiet. 
The area is a bit dirty and there are some problems with cockroaches in the neighborhood, so it's difficult to avoid them in the flat. Thank to the host, he has solved this problem as soon as it was possible.
There is no air conditioner in the flat, but there is a good fan above the bed, so it's OK when you sleep even with 30+ degrees outside.
There is a small balcony where you can dry your clothes and everything you need in the kitchen for cooking.
Thodoris and Stratis were very polite and helped me with everything I needed, being in touch all the time.

As a lone female traveller the area does look quite intimidating on first sight but I felt safer there than in the several other neighbourhoods I've stayed in in Athens. The locals are super friendly and I felt totally safe walking home alone at all times of night; something I wouldn't do at home.
I never met or had much contact with Thodoris but Stratis was an excellent host, even when my flight was delayed so I had a 2am check in. He quickly replied to all of my messages, was super helpful and allowed me to check out later due to a night flight.
The entrance to the building is really secure and clean, the people who live in the building were friendly and welcoming.
Inside the studio itself there is not a lot of natural light but its a comfortable space for 2 people, a really well equipped kitchen and bathroom plus the bonus of a small balcony at the back of the building so a lot of the noise from the area is blocked.
For me personally the only issue I had was that the kitchen and bathroom would really benefit from a deep clean . If the sofa, mattress and bed linen were upgraded too I'd happily pay more to stay again.

204748,0,35,Self Enquiry,3,16,Female,4,4,Deluxe,3,3,1,1,24392,fri,"Awful host and bad property manager.  Don't go. No instructions from the property manager.  No hot water.  Broken washer.  Broken Dishwasher.   All obviously known by the host or her property manager prior to our booking.   The worst, however, was not dirty clothes, or boiling bath water, but the attitude of the host.  When we contacted Katerina, she said let the water run a long while; then she blamed her manager for covering the solar panels and she'd send her to uncover them;  then she would send a plumber.  We went to the electric panel to turn on the stove.  We saw double unmarked breakers taped together, not labeled. (Hmm..could that be the hot water breakers? We left it alone since they were switched off and taped) Someone (a plumber?) must have come while we were out and marked the tape as hot water.  No message from Katerina or her manager.  Still no hot water. Katerina said let it run awhile. Still no hot water.  There was a reason those breakers were taped.
So after boiling water to bathe, we contacted Katerina suggesting that she offer us an adjustment on the rental.  Her response:  ""I'd understand if you choose to leave."" That was all she said.  Ha! On our last evening go to a hotel?  Be further inconvenienced?  
This is the first bad Airnb experience for either of us."

Coming to a new town is always daunting for me so having Georgia check in on what time we were arriving, meeting us, taking us through the apartment, leaving guide books and recommendations on where to eat, where to do a shop was welcomed - thank you! 

However, for the price charged I was not satisfied with the state of the apartment!

The apartment is located on a busy street so while the apartment is relatively quieter inside, the noise of the traffic is unavoidable on the terrace and when the windows are open. There is a view of acropolis  but the terrace really isn’t inviting enough to sit up there and enjoy it.

The apartment itself feels a little neglected and run down with damp patches and paint coming off walls in places.

The apartment was not clean with dust on surfaces, under the bed and around the sofa. While I was doing my yoga exercises in the bedroom I could see a thick layer of dust under the bed - I doubt it has been cleaned under there for a very long time. There was also what looked like cigaret ash on the sofa. 

There is a bit of fiddling with the main power switches when using electrical appliances, the bed upstairs is missing some planks which I mentioned to the owner. I was told to have a closer look and try and fix it myself - my travel partner ended up sleeping on the couch instead.

Prior to our arrival I requested perfume free sheets and towels. We were advised this was in no way a problem as the owner had similar concerns with perfumes and chemicals. Imagine our disappointment to find perfumed sheets, pillows and towels. To the owner’s credit she did try to resolve this particular issue by sending more sheets and towels which some were unfortunately also perfumed. The owner wrote again to say that a freshly washed bed linen set will be delivered the next day. An unwashed brand new set of bed linen did arrive the next day ........ BUT we could not use it because it had not been washed! Along with all the other concerns with the apartment this was just not good enough!

I found the whole experience unprofessional with no consideration for the new guests and the state of the apartment. It felt to be all about the money - very disappointed!"

She was brilliant from the moment we booked the apartment and all during our stay.  Georgia, who checked us in was also terrific and really nice.

The apartment itself is great: it's got everything you need and is full of character and personality, with a very eclectic collection of CDs and lots of books, in Greek, that you just know would be excellent.  And then there is the rooftop garden - as good as it looks in the photos, with a view directly to the Acropolis on one side and Lycabettus Hill on the other.

And the location is perfect. It's very central for exploring Athens, but in a nice quiet residential block, and only a couple of minutes away from the Panathenaic Stadium and the National Garden (a brilliant few minutes stroll through the National Garden takes you right into the heart of Athens).  Aristotle's Lykeion, and a bunch of excellent museums (the Benaki is outstanding) are also just a few minutes walk from the apartment.

 very helpful. The apartment is newly renovated and stylish, 100% as it is shown in the pictures. Furthermore, the apartment was clean and bright as well as fully equipped. 
A big plus is also the location as it is considered as center of Athens, only 2 min walk from the nearest metro of Sygrou fix. 

From now and on Roula's apartment will be first in my priority list when I visit Athens. I would definitely the recommend it to everyone to book it. 

See you soon :)"
